4.  **`src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on your application.

5.  **`components`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what components you want to build.

6.  **`stories`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what stories you want to test with your components.

7.  **`.eslintrc.cjs`**: This file is the configuration file for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

8.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track or maintain during the development process of your project.

9.  **`.index.html`**: This is the HTML page that is served when generating a development or production build.

10. **`LICENSE`**: The template is licensed under the MIT licence.

11. **`package.json`**: Standard manifest file for Node.js projects, which typically includes project specific metadata (such as the project's name, the author among other information). It's based on this file that npm will know which packages are necessary to the project.
